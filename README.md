# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.

->This is a machine learning project aimed to predict if a patient is highly likely to have a heart attack based on his/her demographic and health information, which includes the following:-

Age - Age of the Patient

Sex - Sex of the Patient

Resting blood pressure - Resting blood pressure of the Patient

Chest pain level - Among the 4 major categories of chest pain, what level of pain is the patient experencing

Cholesterol level - Cholesterol level of patient

Fasting Blood Sugar Level

Angina type - Exercise induced angina(kind of a chestpain)

Resting ECQ results - Resting electrocardiographic results; and

Maximum heart rate - Maximum heart rate achieved

-> This project made use of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models in predicting the output which is whether a patient will have a heart attack or not. The two models were then compared for their accuracy and f1-scores to check which model performs best in predicting the results for each individual.
